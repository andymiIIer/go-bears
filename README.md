This is somehow going to be a project relating to college football projections. 

I have a program in data/ that pulls stats from cfbstats.com for every FBS team in the year 2016 to data/data.csv. I will need to add the following capabilities to this package:

- change the year
- get the data in the form of training data for our neural network (i.e. a set of inputs and expected outputs)
- figure out how to pull data from particular games
- figure out how to pull schedule data
